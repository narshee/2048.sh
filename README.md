# 2048.sh
2048 in POSIX Shell  
Besides escape codes and usage of /dev/random this only uses shell builtins.  
There are some neat tricks I have not seen before. Probably because no one is interested in POSIX Shell scripting. I think the code is quite okay, besides the 300 horrible lines of move functions.
